ðŸ”‘ Easily map window functions to keyboard events in React

## Prerequisites

`useKey` is a custom React hook, so you're project must be running React and ReactDOM versions `16.8+`.

### Installation

To install, use your package manager of choice. Here is the command for npm:

```sh
npm i usekey-event-manager
```

## Usage

Import `useKey` from `usekey-event-manager` and pass it a keyboard event map:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import useKey from 'usekey-event-manager'

function Dialog(props) {
    useKey({ Escape: props.closeAndReturnFocus })
    return(
        <div role="alertdialog">
            {/* ... */}
        </div>
    )
}

export default Dialog
```

## API

Version 1+ of `usekey-event-manager` comprises a single export: `useKey`.

### `useKey()`

`useKey` is a custom React hook that assigns a window event listener on keydown. When an event is fired, the listener compares it to a set of selected keys, then calls the action and passes the event object if there is a match.

```js
useKey(Object<String, Function>)
```

If there is a single key that you want to listen for, you can pass a map like so:

```js
useKey({ Escape: close })
```
